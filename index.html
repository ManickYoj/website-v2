					<h3 class="snippet-header">AthenaHealth</h3>
					<p class="snippet-copy">I built web-tools into AthenaHealth's healthcare internet for the print operations time as they, in turn, lifted the grunt-work of filing insurance claims from doctors so that they could focus on the moment of care. To build these tools, I worked directly with stakeholders to co-design a feature-set that would save print-operators' time, facilitate reporting, and enable them to resolve print-errors without contacting and interrupting a development team. At Athena, I learned about healthcare, enterprise-scale infrastructure, and maintaining and interfacing a legacy codebase with present-day user needs.</p>

					<p class="snippet-copy">I wrote code to connect Grove Labs's indoor aquaponic garden, the Ecosystem, to the internet and to empower users to confidently control their Ecosystem using their phone as a remote, a data-tracking tool, and a portal to expert knowledge. While supporting hyper-local, sustainable, and nutritious food, I learned a good bit about mobile-first web application development using the trendiest and newest JavaScript based tools (and gardening).</p>

					<p class="snippet-copy">As part of a three-person team, I built an online, interactive map for locating superior US hospitals according to user-needs: comfort, quality, and affordability. In designing the dashboard for accessibility, we converted raw Medicare data into contextualized percentile grades and built a user-interface aimed at novices that still allowed engaged users to access parameters and results up to their highest granularity.</p>

					<p class="snippet-copy">I co-lead Olin's Aquaponics project team after helping found it last year. We aim to teach and learn about growing food by building and maintaining aquaponic systems. This past semester, we established a charter, built our first operational system, grew our first plants, presented at Olin's exposition, began educational outreach to Catholic Memorial School, and partnered strategically with Grove Labs and groups within Olin to secure material support and access to expertise.</p>

					<h3 class="snippet-header">Mechanical and Electrical Engineering</h3>
					<p class="snippet-copy">Mechanical and Electrical Engineering: I frequently design mechanical systems and interface electrical systems with computers. Some projects I&#39;ve worked on have been:<ul>
						<li>Designing, CADing, and fabricating a <a href="http://mechproto.olin.edu/sp14/final_projects/totally_a_hand.html">robotic grasper</a> that greatly outperformed four others.</li>
						<li>Giving mechanical advice based on static FEA to a team building a cassava press to be deployed in Ghana.</li>
						<li>Designing, fabricating, and programming photographic and infrared 3D scanners.</li>
						<li>Constructing a demonstration internet from the physical to application layer.</li>
					</ul>
					I'm comfortable working alongside mechanical and electrical systems, as well as weaving them together with or without computation.</p>

					<p class="snippet-copy">My education has included a strong design theme. I've spent a semester interviewing and co-designing products and services with users of Tiny Houses. I've applied this knowledge to my development workflow at AthenaHealth, ensuring that the interfaces I build serve each of my identified stakeholders. And, I've advanced my learning outside the classroom, working with faculty and outside experts to create Olin FIT: a week of design outside regular school programming to practice the Sprint methodology - a Google Ventures design strategy.</p>

I'm an active member of <a href="http://olinfoundry.org/">Olin's entrepreneurship group</a>, serving as the liaison to our sister organization at neighboring Babson College. And, I've led a team to flesh out one of my own business concepts, Duelist, in the Entrepreneurship and Opportunity class at Babson. I'm ready and eager to bring my academic entrepreneurial knowledge into the world.</p>
