			<p> <span class="mini-block margin-right"></span>Grove builds high-end aquaponic systems to grow fresh vegetables and herbs in the kitchen. These systems have sensors and actuators connected to the internet and controlled through the Grove OS mobile-optimized web application.</p>

			<p>When I arrived, Grove OS had been freshly constructed (version 0.2). I worked as one of three front-end-focused engineers and helped take us to v0.5. Within my role, I was afforded a large degree of autonomy in selecting and completing those features I chose from the roadmap that our lead UX-Designer and lead engineer had set out. I’ve picked out two of these features as representative examples of my work at Grove.</p>

			<h3>The Frame: Eliminating User Kick-Outs</h3>

			<p>Grove chose to build a web-application rather than a native phone application because it opened up the Grove OS to more users while requiring less development time. In doing so, certain UX compromises were made. When Grove OS launched as an 'application' from a user's home screen, clicking a link within the app would kick the user out of Grove OS, open their web-browser and browse to the linked page.</p>

		  </figure>

			<p> Grove's ecological team, user support team, and early access users had built a robust base of knowledge on the Grove community forum and Grove had built a marketplace for resupplying user's systems. Both the community and marketplace resided on external web-pages. The user kick-outs, in addition to being inconvenient and experience-breaking, prevented Grove from building bridges between the online knowledge base and relevant points in the application.</p>

			<p>To smooth the transition between Grove OS and Grove’s external resources, I added an ‘external link’ component to Grove’s UI toolkit. Upon click, this component caused a mini-browser pane to slide in from the bottom of the page which played a simple CSS-animation until the content loaded. An ‘X’ icon on the browser pane dismissed the pane to the bottom of the page once more, returning the user seamlessly to the page they had left with all state preserved.</p>

			<p>I implemented this browser pane with an iframe. I overcame the main stumbling block - cross-origin request errors - with the help of the Grove lead developer. Though in retrospect a simple solution, the mini-browser sufficiently emulated native application behavior to fully remove the break in user experience from navigating to external pages.</p>

			<h3>Reading Feedback: Granting Users a Green Thumb</h3>

			<p>
				To many of Grove's early adopters, caring for a living system is novel and oftentimes scary. Like new parents, many of our early access customers would ask questions in the vein of 'Is this normal?' and 'What should I do?'. Grove dreams of granting a green thumb to these concerned gardeners, so the ecology team researches and publishes information on the particular ecology of Grove systems. However, at the time I was there, the development team had yet to integrate the published information into Grove OS.
			</p>

				<figcaption><span class="caption-heading">Readings Page Interactions</span> After each new chemical reading, a dropdown pane provides relevant feedback.</figcaption>
		  </figure>

			<p>
				I built a feedback system for aquarium chemical readings to address user’s ecological concerns. When a user entered a new chemical reading, a feedback pane dropped down to inform them if the reading was within the desired range. If the chemical reading fell outside the optimal range, a link (using the browser-frame component I had previously designed) appeared linking to instructions on how to resolve the suboptimal reading.
			</p>

			<p>
				Until an issue was resolved, Grove OS displayed warning signifiers that pervaded further up the UI hierarchy according to the issue’s severity. I defined the optimal and suboptimal chemical ranges, as well as links to the supporting resolution instructions, in a configuration file editable by the ecology team with minimal development team support.
			</p>

			<p>
				The end result was a suite of feedback to ease the minds of novice aquaponic gardeners by providing either a confirmation that everything was alright or an immediately actionable, persistent warning if not. <span class="mini-block margin-left"></span>
