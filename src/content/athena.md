**At AthenaHealth, I worked with print operators and other stakeholders to design and implement web-tools to make printing easier, faster, and more reliable.**

AthenaHealth promises to "let doctors be doctors" by removing the large bureaucratic overhead that reduces the time caregivers can spend giving care. The most mature and critical service Athena provides - Collector - shifts the burden of submitting insurance claims off of doctors. Claims are how doctors get paid, but they commonly take months for insurers to process and are often rejected on technicality. In addition to delaying doctor's cash flow, claims are inevitably dropped because of poor tracking or because they are not worth a doctor's time to contest. By becoming experts in working between doctors and payers, Athena's Collector team gets doctors paid more often and faster.

Despite Athena's effort to enable doctors and insurers to work fully electronically, some insurers require printed and mailed claims, especially for appeals on unpaid claims. That's where the print operations team comes in: a small group of dedicated Athenistas in Belfast, ME who efficiently and correctly print and mail over 50,000 claims each day. Athena's intern program embedded me within the development team that supports the print-operations team. Because printed claims are critical to the cash flow of doctors, the other three members of my development team were frequently called off of new development projects to maintain the infrastructure supporting print. In the daily hustle, 10 years had passed since the user-interfaces with which the print-operations team had worked were updated.

The tool that the print operators interfaced with to marshal print jobs and send them to printers was named commander. Commander was a tangled, 3000-line perl script that had suffered ten years of one-off maintenance hacks in order to provide the print operators with just enough functionality to print using a command-line interface. On the back-end, commander was largely run by pushing files to the right places, and had no communication with the AthenaNet database. My interviews with print operators, print managers, and the dev team swiftly revealed that each stakeholder was suffering from the poor infrastructure.

For the print operators, commander workflows were convoluted with many out of date options (eg. printer alignment settings that were wholly unused), needlessly complex interactions (eg. queuing each batch of claims in a print job with distinct commands), and lack of relevant information (eg. page counts). Commander impeded workflows when it should have accelerated them, and necessitated extra training time for new print-operators. For print operations management, commander did not offer simple reporting on print outcomes. For each of 9 types of print batches, the managers would receive a daily email with the information on the number of claims printed. For each monthly report and analysis, the managers would manually add up the line items in each of the 270 emails in order to create a spreadsheet. For the dev team supporting print operations, commander's convoluted code structure required extended dev-time for necessary updates and maintenance. More importantly, the lack of transparency in commander's status and reporting meant that when an error occurred in printing, the print operations team would need to contact the dev team to manually comb through the file structures supporting commander to find, diagnose, and repair the errored files. As I saw repeatedly during my internship, errors interrupted the workflows of all stakeholders.

From my stakeholder interviews, I developed three goals for a new print interface. First, I would streamline the workflows for print-operators by stripping out unused print options, making pertinent information on print batches available, and replacing the command-line interface with a web-interface instantly familiar to new operators. Second, I would automate reporting such that a print manager could at any time collate custom reports and export them to excel. Third, I would automate some error diagnosis and show print operators what had gone wrong with the eventual goal of empowering print operators to fix print errors without needing the dev team. Along the way, I also designed for maintainability, moving from file-structures to the database, from monolithic scripts into manageable subsystems, and from one-off if-statements to editable configuration files.

Over the course of eight weeks, I made steady progress towards all of my stated goals, creating bare-bones interfaces to start and hooking features onto the framework in iterations such that I was able to release the current interface to the print operations team as I went. As I released features, I talked with the print-operations team to relate and receive feedback on both the current and next version. The privilege of being able to contact my stakeholders regularly allowed me to avoid (most) of the time I might waste building out features incorrectly or features that would remain unused. Along the way I received tremendous assistance from the print operations lead developer, who happily and tirelessly filled in gaps in my knowledge, arranged user-interviews, and discussed with me my infrastructural plans.

Thanks to the consistent support of my development team and the users for whom I was working, I was able to complete all major objectives within my eight week internship and hand-off a complete, maintainable web interface that achieved my goals of streamlining workflows, automating reporting, and empowering print-operations.
