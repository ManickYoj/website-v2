When the Design Axioms first caught my attention hanging from clotheslines on a friend's wall, my questions led me to Invo's website. When, inspired by all I saw, I spied office hours and only a bike ride's distance between us, I came to visit. First, I discovered that Eric was more bearded than I had been led to believe. I also discovered a place where a designer could work beside a medical illustrator while thinking ahead to visions of health-care's tomorrow. I'd like to take part in that vision.

My name is Nick Francisci and I'm an engineer with a proclivity towards design. I'm just about to leave a really cool engineering school - one you've heard of. They taught me to talk to my user. Then they did it a couple more times. They also taught me how to deliver iterative prototypes with a small team on a short timeline, then they did that 22 more times. Most recently, I worked at AthenaHealth, designing and implementing a replacement of the core software tools used by their print operations team. I've also worked at a cool company that builds aquaponic systems - one you've heard of (RIP, kitchen Ecosystem). I built UIs from version 0.2-0.5 of their app. I saw your excited faces with your ecosystem in a photo on the community forum. I mourn the passing of your fish.

The coolest thing I am running right now is a week-long design and entrepreneurship intensive named FIT. Scaffolded by a semester of lectures and workshops provided by speakers including Greg Marra and Ellen Chisa, each participant will prototype and user-test an entrepreneurial or social venture in one day, then help their four teammates do the same for their ideas. After I conceptualized FIT last year, I worked with three student co-organizers to bring it into being, receiving $8,000 in financial backing and obtaining administrative approval to open the campus to FIT one week before the next school semester starts.
